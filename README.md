## 👀 What I'm Passionate About
I'm on a mission to explore how **AI and cybersecurity** can work hand-in-hand to build smarter, safer systems. Whether it’s **network penetration testing**, **predicting hospital stays**, or building **voice-controlled robots**, I thrive at the intersection of **innovation and impact**.

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Working On
- 📡 End-of-year MLOps project to predict hospital Length of Stay (LOS) using XGBoost, Spark & Flask
- 🧪 Security research on Wi-Fi protocols (WPA2/WPA3) using Kali Linux and packet inspection tools
- 🤖 Voice-controlled robot built with Arduino and Bluetooth commands

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- 🧠 Deep Learning with PyTorch
- 📊 SHAP & LIME for AI explainability
- 🐍 Advanced Python for automation & data engineering
- 🛰️ Penetration testing techniques (Wireshark, Aircrack-ng, Evil Twin attacks)

## 💬 Ask Me About
- Network monitoring, OTDR diagnostics, and FTTH-GPON deployment  
- Flask & React-based full-stack projects  
- Real-time AI deployment with Docker & Kubernetes  
- Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and ethical hacking labs

## 💞️ I’m Open to Collaborating On
- 🔐 Cybersecurity projects (especially Wi-Fi & network penetration testing)
- 🧠 AI for healthcare or IoT solutions
- 🌐 Full-stack web apps with a backend in Flask or JEE
